# ROSbot-ROS

**Project Name** - ROSbot Motion Planning Simulation using LiDAR 

**Vidoe** -

**Description** -
1. Created C++ node in ROS for ROSbot to exit the path from Costa Coffee Simulation.
2. Utilized OOPs conecpts by creating classes with attributes and methods.
3. Created Velocity Publisher & Laser, Odometry Subscriber in the same ROS node.
4. Build the executable using CMakeList.txt

**Implementation** -
1. clone the repository as ROS package
2. build it using catkin_make
3. launch simulation files (I used Robot Development Studio)
3. run the node using `rosrun rosbot rosbot_move_node`
